Run the following scripts to compute multilayer network measures (i.e., flexibility, integration, and recruitment) and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Example input and output data were in folder "example_data". Sepcifically:

1. 01_compute_Aij.m: a matlab script converting time series to multilayer networks. Example analysis starts with one HBN-SSI subject's BOLD time series extracted from 200 ROIs (Craddock et al., 2011) from one session and 4 tasks.
2. 02_compute_SRep.m: a matlab script performing multilayer community detection using GenLouvain algorithm. Input is generated from step1_compute_Aij.m
3. 03_compute_dynamic_measures.m: a matlab script computing flexibility, modular allegiance matrix, integration, and recruitment. Input is generated from step2_compute_SRep.m
4. run_hierachical_ICC.R: an R script compute hierarchical ICC using hierarchical linear mixed models to assess between-session and between-condition reliability in the same model. Example input and output are in folder: Reliability_Multilayer_Networks/Brain_Imaging_Data/example_data/hierarchical_ICC/
5. run_simple_ICC: a bash script compute ICC using simple linear mixed model to assess between-session reliability. Example input is in folder: Reliability_Multilayer_Networks/Brain_Imaging_Data/example_data/ICC/input/; Example output is in folder: Reliability_Multilayer_Networks/Brain_Imaging_Data/example_data/ICC/output/

The functions called by these scripts are in the following folder: 
1. "functions" which include either customized functions or functions downloaded from http://commdetect.weebly.com/
2. "grinsted-wavelet-coherence-gus", a package downloaded from http://grinsted.github.io/wavelet-coherence/
3. "GenLouvain2.1.2", a package downloaded from http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain
